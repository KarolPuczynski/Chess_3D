# 3D Chess Game
This project is a 3D chess game developed in Python using OpenGL and it is a part of Computer Graphics course project.

All 3D models of the chess pieces and the board were custom-designed and created by me and my colleague using Fusion 360.

## About the game
This game allows switching between 3D and 2D modes. It also features sound effects that indicate each move, helping you better follow the gameplay.
